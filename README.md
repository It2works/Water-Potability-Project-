# Water Potability Project

This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict water potability based on various physicochemical properties.

## Introduction

Access to safe and clean drinking water is essential for public health. Water potability refers to the suitability of water for drinking purposes, determined by its chemical composition and other factors. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict water potability based on the analysis of physicochemical properties.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about the physicochemical properties of water samples collected from various sources. It includes features such as pH level, hardness, chlorides, and more, along with the potability status of each water sample.

You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability).

## Models

The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated in this project:

- Random Forest
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Gradient Boosting

## Preprocessing

Various preprocessing techniques were applied to the data before training the models, including normalization methods such as Minmax, Z-score, and Robust scaling. Additionally, feature engineering techniques like sum, vectorization, log transformation, and square root transformation were employed to enhance the model's performance.

## Evaluation

The models were evaluated based on various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. The goal is to develop models that accurately predict water potability based on the input features.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the main script or Jupyter notebook to train and evaluate the machine learning models.
3. Experiment with different preprocessing techniques and model parameters to improve performance.
